 * @brief This effect causes Actors to appear to rotate around a 3D cube.

 * It should be used on the following Actor hierarchy:
 *
 * ScrollView
 * |
 * Page (1..n)
 * |
 * Child (1..m)
 *
 * You should ensure ScrollView's default constraints have been removed,
 * by calling ScrollView::RemoveConstraintsFromChildren() before applying
 * this effect to ScrollView.
 *
 * Manual operation:
 * upon adding children to pages, the ApplyToActor(...) method should be called.
 *
 * Automatic operation:
 * not implemented.
