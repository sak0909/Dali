/**
 *
 * GaussianBlurView is a class for applying a render process that blurs an image.
 *
 * Basic idea:-
 *
 * 1) The GaussianBlurView object will render all its child actors offscreen.\n
 * 2) The GaussianBlurView object then blurs the result of step 1), using a two pass separated Gaussian blur.\n
 * 3) The GaussianBlurView object then composites the blur from step 2) with the child actors image from step 1). See GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex() for more info.\n
 * 4) The GaussianBlurView object gets rendered automatically, either to the screen via the default render task, or via a RenderTask the user has created for
 * e.g. further offscreen rendering.
 *
 * Fundamentally, the GaussianBlurView is simply an Actor in the normal actor tree that affects all of its children. It should be added to your Actor tree and manipulated in the
 * normal ways. It can be considered a 'portal' in the sense that all child actors are clipped to the GaussianBlurView actor bounds.
 *
 * ************\n
 * NB: It is essential to remove the GaussianBlurView from the stage and also to call Deactivate() on it when you are not using it. This will ensure that resources are freed and
 * rendering stops.\n
 * ************\n
 *
 * Usage example:-
 *
 *  // initialise\n
 *  GaussianBlurView gaussianBlurView = GaussianBlurView::New();\n
 *
 *  // create and add some visible actors to the GaussianBlurView, all these child actors will therefore get blurred.\n
 *  Image image = Image::New(...);\n
 *  ImageActor imageActor = ImageActor::New(image);\n
 *  gaussianBlurView.Add(imageActor);\n
 *  ...\n
 *
 *  // Start rendering the GaussianBlurView\n
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Add(gaussianBlurView);\n
 *  gaussianBlurView.Activate();\n
 *  ...\n
 *
 *  // animate the strength of the blur - this can fade between no blur and full blur. See GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex().\n
 *  Animation blurAnimation = Animation::New( ... );\n
 *  blurAnimation.AnimateTo( Property( gaussianBlurView, gaussianBlurView.GetBlurStrengthPropertyIndex() ), ... );\n
 *  blurAnimation.Play();\n
 *
 *  ...\n
 *  // Stop rendering the GaussianBlurView\n
 *  Stage::GetCurrent().Remove(gaussianBlurView);\n
 *  gaussianBlurView.Deactivate();\n
