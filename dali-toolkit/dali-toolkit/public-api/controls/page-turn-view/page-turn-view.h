/**
 * PageTurnView is a base class of different mode of pageTurnViews ( portrait or landscape )
 * Page actors are provided from an external PageFactory
 * PanGesture is used to activate the page bending, streching and tuning forward/backward
 *
 * Signal usage: There are four signals. Two matching pairs for panning and page turning:
 * PagePanStarted/PagePanFinished and PageTurnStarted/PageTurnFinished. Panning relates to user interaction with
 * the screen while page turning refers to animation of the page. There are three scenarios for these
 * events: normal page turn (forwards or backwards), aborted page turn (forwards or backwards)
 * and pan with no animation. The order of events is as follows:
 * 1) Normal page turn: PagePanStarted -> PageTurnStarted direction -> PagePanFinished -> PageTurnFinished direction
 * 2) Aborted page turn: PagePanStarted -> PageTurnStarted direction -> PageTurnStarted opposite direction
 *                       -> PagePanFinished -> PageTurnFinished opposite direction
 * 3) Pan with no animation: PagePanStarted -> PagePanFinished
 * Pan with no animation will occur when the user touches the page in an area that does not start the
 * page turning.
