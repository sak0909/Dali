/**
 * @brief MaskedImageView displays the result of an image created from a masking operation.
 *
 * Masking operations:
 *  - Firstly a target image size is chosen. The MaskedImageView handles the creation of this image internally. Initially the
 *    target image will be filled according to the BACKGROUND_COLOR property.
 *  - A source image is provided and positioned with the target image area. The position of the source image (in pixels), can
 *    be controlled using the SOURCE_OFFSET and SOURCE_SIZE properties. By default the source image is centered within the target
 *    image, and stretched to fill. Note that by default, no attempt is made to maintain the aspect ratio of the source image.
 *  - A mask image is provided and positioned in the same way as the source image, using the MASK_OFFSET and MASK_SIZE properties.
 *  - Conceptually the source image is then painted using the mask image as a stencil. Areas of the source which overlap with opaque
 *    areas of the mask, will be painted into the target image. However where the mask is transparent, the source will be faded away.
 *    Note that the edge of the mask image will be stretched to cover the entire target area.
 *
 * Initially MaskedImageView will perform the masking operation on a per-frame basis. This can impact performance, and may be
 * avoided by calling Pause() e.g. when the source & mask positions are not being modified. The Resume() method can then be called
 * to continue the masking operation when required.
