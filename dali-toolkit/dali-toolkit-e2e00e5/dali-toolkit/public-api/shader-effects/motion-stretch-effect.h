 * Class for motion stretch shader that works on a per object basis. Objects will stretch in the direction of motion when they move, or if the camera moves. Can be applied

 * Usage example:-
 *
 * // Create shader used for doing motion stretch\n
 * MotionStretchEffect MotionStretchEffect = MotionStretchEffect::New();
 *
 * // set actor shader to the stretch one\n
 * Actor Actor = Actor::New( ... );\n
 * Actor.SetShaderEffect( MotionStretchEffect );
