/**
 * @brief NinePatchMaskEffect is used to control which parts of an image are visible, using the alpha channel of a separate mask image.
 *
 * The mask image is expected to be smaller than the main image being viewed.
 * Conceptually the mask image is divided into a 3x3 grid (9 patches). The middle patch is stretched whilst the outer border is not.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 * @code
 *   ImageActor actor = ImageActor::New( Image( EXAMPLE_IMAGE_PATH ) );
 *   NinePatchMaskEffect::Apply( actor, MASK_IMAGE_PATH );
 * @endcode
 *
 * NinePatchMaskEffect is mutually exclusive with ImageActor::STYLE_NINE_PATCH i.e. the actor's main image should not be a nine-patch.
