/**
 *
 * Class for two state displacement effect shader that works on a per object basis. By passing a height-normal map as an effect image, the user can create
 * various styles of buttons on an image actor. The shader requires two height-normal maps in one image, one for each state.
 *
 *    The normals and height information for the two states of the button should be strictly specified in this format:
 *     ______________
 *    |   State 0    |
 *    |              |
 *    |              | --> Unpressed button normals in rgb and height in a
 *    |     Map      |
 *    |______________|
 *    |   State 1    |
 *    |              |
 *    |              | --> Pressed button normals in rgb and height in a
 *    |     Map      |
 *    |______________|
 *
 *    The RGB values should contain the surface normals and the alpha should contian the height map. For a better effect keep the highest point (alpha value) in
 *    the combined map as 1.0 and the lowest posint as 0.0 and 0.5 for any region which doesn't need displacement.
 *
 *    For the supplied Normal map the Y-Axis should be down, Meaning (0,0) is in the top left. As the shader inverts the Y axis for lighting calculation.
 *
 *    Limitations: Can be applied to ImageActor only, And doesn't provide support for specular color.
 *
 * Usage example:-
 *
 * // Create shader used for doing soft button\n
 * DisplacementEffect buttonEffect = DisplacementEffect::New();
 * buttonEffect.SetEffectImage(Image::New( FANCY_BUTTON_HEIGHT_MAP_IMAGE_PATH ););
 *
 * // set shader to the soft button\n
 * ImageActor fancyButton = ImageActor::New( ... );\n
 * fancyButton.SetShaderEffect( buttonEffect );
 *
 * // animate a button push, using e.g. AlphaFunctions::Bounce. With these values the button pushes in and out (animates to and fro between the two states)
 *
 *
 * Animation animation = Animation::New( ... );\n
 * animation.AnimateTo( Property(buttonEffect, buttonEffect.GetStatePropertyName()), 1.0f, AlphaFunctions::Bounce, ... );\n
 * animation.Play();\n
 *
