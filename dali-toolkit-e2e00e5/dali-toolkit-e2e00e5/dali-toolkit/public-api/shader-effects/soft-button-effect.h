/**
 *
 * Class for soft button shader that works on a per object basis. Using animatable parameters user can create effect of button pushing in / out. Can be applied to ImageActor only.
 *
 * Usage example:-
 *
 * // Create shader used for doing soft button\n
 * SoftButtonEffect softButtonEffect = SoftButtonEffect::New();
 *
 * // set image actor shader to the soft button one\n
 * ImageActor imageActor = ImageActor::New( ... );\n
 * imageActor.SetShaderEffect( softButtonEffect );
 *
 * // animate a button push, using e.g. AlphaFunctions::Bounce. With these values the button pushes in and pops out slightly at the end\n
 * Animation animation = Animation::New( ... );\n
 * animation.AnimateTo( Property(softButtonEffect, softButtonEffect.GetLightingIndentationAmountPropertyName()), 0.25f, AlphaFunctions::Bounce, ... );\n
 * animation.AnimateTo( Property(softButtonEffect, softButtonEffect.GetLightingIndentationAmountPropertyName()), -0.05f, AlphaFunctions::Bounce, ... );\n
 * animation.AnimateTo( Property(softButtonEffect, softButtonEffect.GetTextureDistortionAmountPropertyName()), 0.25f, AlphaFunctions::Bounce, ... );\n
 * animation.AnimateTo( Property(softButtonEffect, softButtonEffect.GetTextureDistortionAmountPropertyName()), -0.05f, AlphaFunctions::Bounce, ... );\n
 * animation.Play();\n
